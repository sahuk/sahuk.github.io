Using Django and web scraping from several sources, I created a [database over tax treaties][link-eoi-tax].
	The purpose was to see how many of the traditional tax havens that still remain,
	and see which countries are striking down the hardest on money laundering and tax evasion.

The following key technologies were used:
* Python
* Django
* Beautiful Soup
* `nginx`
* `git`
* `sqlite`
